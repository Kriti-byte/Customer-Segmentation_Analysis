# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis
Project Highlights:
*Data Exploration: Begin by examining the data, checking for missing values, and understanding customer demographics like gender and order history.
*Feature Engineering:Create a new feature, "Total Search," to measure overall product browsing activity.
*Data Visualization: Seaborn to create informative visualizations like count plots, boxplots, histograms and heatmaps to understand data distribution and relationships between variables.
*K-Means Clustering: K-Means algorithm segments the customers into distinct clusters based on their search behavior and purchase history.
*Model Evaluation: Utilize silhouette analysis and the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for customer segmentation.
*Cluster Analysis: Analyze each cluster to identify unique customer profiles within each segment.
